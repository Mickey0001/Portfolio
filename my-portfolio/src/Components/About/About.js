				<h2>About</h2>
				<p className="text-justify">I've always been a technology geek, friends and family would come to me to solve their computer related problems so one fine day I  realized that since I love doing it as a hobby why not do it professionally! I decided to drop out of college (I used to study history, I still love reading history books but I love tech even more) and I started fixing PC's on the side. After that I took a few <a href="http://www.mycertprofile.com/Profile/1947938383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Certificates</a> and those helped me land my first full time IT job - I got a remote position as a tech support specialist working for a 
				<a href="http://learninglibrary.com/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Canadian e-learning  company</a>. I worked in tech support for little over two and a half years, while I enjoyed the job  felt a little too easy and I needed new challenges. That is when I decided to start learing to code. In January 2017 I discovered <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/mickey0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Free Code Camp</a> and started working on their curriculum. I completed their <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/mickey0001/front-end-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Front-End Development Certification</a> on February 2nd 2018. I'm currently focusing on getting better at React and working on FFC's Data Visualization Certification.</p>
				<p className="text-justify">Since I started learning web development I completed a lot of tutorials (over 200 hours in Udemy courses) but I realized that in order to retain what I've learned it need to start making projects. I started small, making a few websites for friends and a doing bit of <a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01a70d936afbbff30e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> freelancing</a> on the side. You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/Mickey0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> GitHub profile</a>  to see most of the projects I worked on. When I get stuck I resort to Google-fu and usually end up finding answers on sites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/7443287/mirza-sisic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> StackOverflow</a> and occassiinaly I'll even post a questions there, what can I say I like to live dangerously
